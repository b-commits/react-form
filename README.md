## Technologies

Since [Redux Form ](https://redux-form.com/8.3.0/) appears to be depracted and is no longer supported, the project uses [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) instead to handle its form's state. The state is also stored globally with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).
